### How to create a new daq

 1) Duplicate and rename the file `ExampleDaq.py` from the `probecard/daq/` folder and use it as a template daq. **Note**: You must rename the class definition => `class ExampleDaq` to `class MyDaq`.
 2) Write the protocol of the daq using the functions available to you from the `BaseProbecardThread.py`. Note there are some functions only avialable to you in the `probecard/daq/utilities/controller.py` like `setGroundMode` that you can acces from your daq code by referencing `self.controller` like `self.controller.setGroundMode(False)` or `self.controller.getResistance()`. Look at `probecard/daq/SinglePixelDaq.py` as an example.
 3) Once you have created your daq file you need to attach it to the main menu at `probecard/probecard.py`. Please note the `state` object in the if statement `if __name__ == "__main__": `, these are all of the available states. In the function `startExperiment`of `probecard.py`, find the state you want your daq to run like `msg=='all'` or `msg=='calib'` and create an instance of your daq, and connect `newData`,`done`, and `log` signals to the window functions `addPoint`, `finalize`, `log` respectivly. You can look at `msg=='single'` as an example. Then start your daq.
 4) If you need some unique parameters from the main menu, then add a state widget after the `TwoPaneWindow` is instantiated. Example: ```menuWindow.addStateWidget(states['single'],(QLabel('Channel Number (N)'),menuWindow.getLineEdit('channel_number')))```.
